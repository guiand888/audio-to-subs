**Script Purpose Summary for AI Coding Agent:**

**Objective:**
Develop a script that automates the process of extracting audio from video files (e.g., TV series episodes, movies), pipes the extracted audio to an AI model (such as Mistral, VoxTarl, or similar) for transcription, and generates a timestamped subtitle file (e.g., SRT format) for the original video.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Audio Extraction:** Extract audio tracks from input video files.
2. **AI Transcription:** Pipe the extracted audio to an AI model for speech-to-text transcription.
3. **Timestamp Alignment:** Ensure the transcribed text is aligned with timestamps suitable for subtitles.
4. **Subtitle Generation:** Output a complete subtitle file (e.g., SRT) synchronized with the original video.

**Input/Output:**
- **Input:** Video files (e.g., `.mp4`, `.mkv`).
- **Output:** Subtitle files (e.g., `.srt`) with accurate timestamps and transcribed text.

**Goal:** Create a seamless pipeline for converting video audio into ready-to-use subtitles.
